# Your code #

### Summary ###

Your code was good, but I found a few places you could improve it.

### Improvement 1 ###

Proper Python formatting is described in great detail in PEP 8. You should probably read that over.

### Improvement 2 ###

Typically, in a professional setting, we don't use profanity in function names.
